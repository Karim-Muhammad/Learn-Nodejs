### What is the Server?
> server is software(program) that running on this big PC/Device, works 24/7, his job is listening any action user ask, like access to url for example.
and we here do this program for our server.

we will use `http` module now, but later we will use `express` because it will ease for us this job, because if we used `http` will be some complex maybe

`port` is as tunnel between server and client to listen url and respond 
this time is so important: [video: http] `5:55`

in our devices we have many programs and can be there are many servers in one device, hence each program/server run on something is called 'port' 

<!--  -->
localhost:3000
localhost is refer to *ip* : 127.0.0.1
3000 refer to *port*
=== `127.0.0.1:3000`

like facebook.com
facebook refer to *ip*: 69.63.176.13
and it has so many ip not this only.

<!-- Methods -->
```js
console.log(req.method)
```
GET -> refer to get some data from url
POST -> refer to take these data into your server and deal with it

Nodejs is different from PHP in dealing with requests, responses
